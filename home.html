            <p>While COVID-19 has been messing around with the past year’s fashion week schedule, we have high hopes for 2021. Despite that many fashion weeks will remain a combination of both physical and digital events, the show must go on. Expect an entirely different look on fashion, though, as many designers have taken the time to focus on what their label stands for – while preparing for a more sustainable future. Find out the fashion week schedules of 2021 below and keep an eye on this page for updates.</p>
