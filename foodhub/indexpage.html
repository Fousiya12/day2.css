                Food is one mandatory element in wedding planning. Different types of cuisines, more than 15 dishes, banana-leaf meals, live counters, chaat, etc.. Mouth-watering, isn't it?
                
                A wedding is never complete until the wedding guests come to the hosts and talk about the wedding meal. Wedding is an occasion where the energy must be at its peak and food is essential to create that energy.
                
                Indian weddings have seen different cuisines apart from home cuisine. For example, the inclusion of live momo counters, manchurian, cheese balls, burgers, etc.. They have also seen different style of serving apart from the usual plate service. For example, buffet stalls at wedding receptions is one such area where all the creativity is used. Be it the inclusion of live counters, food trucks, multi-cuisine dishes, etc..
                
                Apart from the wedding day, Indian weddings have some pre-wedding rituals like haldi ceremony, mehendi ceremony, sangeet ceremony, etc.. Food along with drinks are a common element in these ceremonies. Here, as the guest count would be comparatively less, the serving style and dishes served can be experimented with. With different types on meals and cuisines like welcome drinks, high tea, North Indian thali, South Indian cuisine, Chinese, Italian, and mediterranean cuisines, etc., there are lot of options to choose from.
